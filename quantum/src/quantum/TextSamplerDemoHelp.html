<p>Welcome test subje-- I mean, valued employee. I hope you are having a good day. If not, cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.
<p>If this is your first time using this service, please read the documentation.
<p>The writer is simple. Grab the id, or class name, from the respective HTML element, and simply add it here and tell me what action you would like to take on it.
<p>In standard HTML formatting, a tag would be represented as so:
<p> &lt;a href='/dummyURL' id='thisUrl' class='thisClass'&gt; Click Here! &lt;/a&gt;
<p>'a' refers to an anchor tag. This is a clickable button (generally)
<p>href is a hypertext reference. The characters following are generally the link to a URL or web address
<p>id is the (hopefully) unique identifier for the tag. This will be your go-to identifier for creating these Selenium scripts.
<p>class is the CSS class. this is also targetable by selenium in the event that an id is not available
<p>'Click Here!' is the inner HTML of the tag. This is what is displayed to the user.
<p>"</a>" is the closing tag. This tells the HTML interpreter (aka a webpage) that the tag is done.
<p>There are many tag types in HTML. All of these tags have some kind of unique identifer. It is your job to find this unique identifiers.
<p>
<p>It is my job to do the rest.
<p>...
<p>Please note that we have added a consequence for failure.
<p>Any bad data entered will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death.
<p>
<p>I am now going to prompt you for two different URL types.
<p>The first one is the end of the URL. This is the specific page.
<p>If your URL was http://yahoo.com/signup , you would only enter /signup.
<p>If you are on the homepage of the website and there is no '/' , enter /index.
<p>
<p>Then I will prompt you for the base URL. This is the https:// ... whatever. With no slash at the end.
